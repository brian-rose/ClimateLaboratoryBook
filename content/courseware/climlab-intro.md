## 1. Introducing climlab
____________


## About climlab

climlab is a specialized python package for process-oriented climate modeling.

It is based on a very general concept of a model as a collection of individual, 
interacting processes. climlab defines a base class called `Process`, which
can contain an arbitrarily complex tree of sub-processes (each also some 
sub-class of `Process`). Every climate process (radiative, dynamical, 
physical, turbulent, convective, chemical, etc.) can be simulated as a stand-alone
process model given appropriate input, or as a sub-process of a more complex model. 
New classes of model can easily be defined and run interactively by putting together an
appropriate collection of sub-processes.

climlab is an open-source community project. The latest code can always be found on github:

https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab

## Installing climlab

If you've followed [these instructions from the Climate Laboratory book](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/how-to.html), then you should be all set -- climlab is automatically installed as part of the suite of tools used in [The Climate Laboratory](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook).

If you are maintaining your own Python installation (e.g. on a personal laptop), you can always install climlab by doing

```
conda install -c conda-forge climlab
```

## 2. Using climlab to implement the zero-dimensional energy balance model
____________

+++

### The model equation (recap)

Recall that we have worked with a zero-dimensional Energy Balance Model

$$ C \frac{dT_s}{dt} = (1-\alpha) Q - \tau \sigma T_s^4 $$ 

+++

Here we are going to implement this exact model using climlab.

Yes, we have already written code to implement this model, but we are going to repeat this effort here as a way of learning how to use climlab.

There are tools within climlab to implement much more complicated models, but the basic interface will be the same.

+++

### Create the state variables for the model

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  As usual, we start with some import statements.
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import climlab  # import climlab just like any other package
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# create a zero-dimensional domain with a single surface temperature
state = climlab.surface_state(num_lat=1,  # a single point
                              water_depth = 100.,  # 100 meters slab of water (sets the heat capacity)
                             )
print(state)
```

Here we have created a dictionary called `state` with a single item called `Ts`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(state['Ts'])
```

This dictionary holds the state variables for our model -- which is this case is a single number!  It is a **temperature in degrees Celsius**.

+++

For convenience, we can access the same data as an attribute (which lets us use tab-autocomplete when doing interactive work):

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(state.Ts)
```

It is also possible to see this `state` dictionary as an `xarray.Dataset` object:

```{code-cell} ipython3
climlab.to_xarray(state)
```

### Create the subcomponents of the model

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  create the longwave radiation process
olr = climlab.radiation.Boltzmann(name='OutgoingLongwave',
                                  state=state, 
                                  tau = 0.612,
                                  eps = 1.,
                                  timestep = 60*60*24*30.)
#  Look at what we just created
print(olr)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  create the shortwave radiation process
asr = climlab.radiation.SimpleAbsorbedShortwave(name='AbsorbedShortwave',
                                                state=state, 
                                                insolation=341.3, 
                                                albedo=0.299,
                                                timestep = 60*60*24*30.)
#  Look at what we just created
print(asr)
```

### Create the model by coupling the subcomponents

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  couple them together into a single model
ebm = climlab.couple([olr,asr])
#  Give the parent process name
ebm.name = 'EnergyBalanceModel'
#  Examine the model object
print(ebm)
```

The object called `ebm` here is the entire model -- including its current state (the temperature `Ts`) as well as all the methods needed to integrated forward in time!

+++

The current model state, accessed two ways:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(ebm.state)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(ebm.Ts)
```

### Take a single timestep forward

+++

Here is some internal information about the timestep of the model:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(ebm.time['timestep'])
print(ebm.time['steps'])
```

This says the timestep is 2592000 seconds (30 days!), and the model has taken 0 steps forward so far.

+++

To take a single step forward:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm.step_forward()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm.Ts
```

The model got colder!

To see why, let's look at some useful diagnostics computed by this model:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm.diagnostics
```

This is another dictionary, now with two items. They should make sense to you.

Just like the `state` variables, we can access these `diagnostics` variables as attributes:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm.OLR
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm.ASR
```

So why did the model get colder in the first timestep?

What do you think will happen next?

## 3. Run the zero-dimensional EBM out to equilibrium
____________

+++

Let's look at how the model adjusts toward its equilibrium temperature.

### Exercise

- Using a `for` loop, take 500 steps forward with this model
- Store the current temperature at each step in an array
- Make a graph of the temperature as a function of time

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

## 4. A climate change scenario 
____________

+++

### Description of the scenario

Suppose we want to investigate the effects of a small decrease in the transmissitivity of the atmosphere `tau`. 

Previously we used the zero-dimensional model to investigate a **hypothetical climate change scenario** in which:
- the transmissitivity of the atmosphere `tau` decreases to 0.57
- the planetary albedo increases to 0.32

+++

### Implement the scenario in climlab

How would we do that using `climlab`?

Recall that the model is comprised of two sub-components:

```{code-cell} ipython3
for name, process in ebm.subprocess.items():
    print(name)
    print(process)
```

The parameter `tau` is a property of the `OutgoingLongwave` subprocess:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm.subprocess['OutgoingLongwave'].tau
```

and the parameter `albedo` is a property of the `AbsorbedShortwave` subprocess:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm.subprocess['AbsorbedShortwave'].albedo
```

Let's make an exact clone of our model and then change these two parameters:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm2 = climlab.process_like(ebm)
print(ebm2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm2.subprocess['OutgoingLongwave'].tau = 0.57
ebm2.subprocess['AbsorbedShortwave'].albedo = 0.32
```

Now our model is out of equilibrium and the climate will change!

To see this without actually taking a step forward:

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  Computes diagnostics based on current state but does not change the state
ebm2.compute_diagnostics()
ebm2.ASR - ebm2.OLR
```

Shoud the model warm up or cool down?

+++

Well, we can find out:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm2.Ts
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm2.step_forward()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm2.Ts
```

### Automatic timestepping

+++

Often we want to integrate a model forward in time to equilibrium without needing to store information about the transient state.

`climlab` offers convenience methods to do this easily:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm3 = climlab.process_like(ebm2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm3.integrate_years(50)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  What is the current temperature?
ebm3.Ts
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  How close are we to energy balance?
ebm3.ASR - ebm3.OLR
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  We should be able to accomplish the exact same thing with explicit timestepping
for n in range(608):
    ebm2.step_forward()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm2.Ts
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ebm2.ASR - ebm2.OLR
```
