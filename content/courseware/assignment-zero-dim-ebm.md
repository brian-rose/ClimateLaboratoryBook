## Learning goals

Students completing this assignment will gain the following skills and concepts:

- Familiarity with the Jupyter notebook
- Familiarity with the zero-dimensional Energy Balance Model
- Understanding of the adjustment toward equilibrium temperature
- Introduction to the concept of albedo feedback
- Use of numerical timestepping to find the equilibrium temperature
- Python programming skills: arrays, loops, and simple graphs

+++

## Instructions

- In a local copy of this notebook (on the JupyterHub or your own device) **add your answers in additional cells**.
- **Complete the required problems** below. 
- Some assignments have **optional bonus problems**. These are meant to be interesting and thought-provoking, but are not required. Extra credit will be given for interesting answers to the bonus problems.
- Remember to set your cell types to `Markdown` for text, and `Code` for Python code!
- **Include comments** in your code to explain your method as necessary.
- Remember to actually answer the questions. **Written answers are required** (not just code and figures!)
- Submit your solutions in **a single Jupyter notebook** that contains your text, your code, and your figures.
- *Make sure that your notebook* ***runs cleanly without errors:***
    - Save your notebook
    - From the `Kernel` menu, select `Restart & Run All`
    - Did the notebook run from start to finish without error and produce the expected output?
    - If yes, save again and submit your notebook file
    - If no, fix the errors and try again.

## Problem 1: Time-dependent warming in the zero-dimensional Energy Balance Model

+++

In lecture we defined a zero-dimensional energy balance model for the global mean surface temperature $T_s$ as follows

$$ C  \frac{dT_s}{dt} = \text{ASR} - \text{OLR}$$

$$ \text{ASR} = (1-\alpha) Q $$

$$ \text{OLR} = \tau \sigma T_s^4$$

where we defined these terms:

- $C$ is a heat capacity for the atmosphere-ocean column
- $\alpha$ is the global mean planetary albedo
- $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}$ W m$^{-2}$ K$^{-4}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant
- $\tau$ is our transmissivity parameter for the atmosphere.
- $Q$ is the global-mean incoming solar radiation, or *insolation*.

+++

Refer back to our class notes for parameter values.

1. If the heat penetrated to twice as deep into the ocean, the value of $C$ would be twice as large. Would this affect the **equilibrium temperature**? Why or why not?
2. In class we used numerical timestepping to investigate a *hypothetical climate change scenario* in which $\tau$ decreases to 0.57 and $\alpha$ increases to 0.32. We produced a graph of $T_s(t)$ over a twenty year period, starting from an initial temperature of 288 K. Here you will repeat this calculate with a larger value of $C$ and compare the warming rates. Specifically:
    - Repeat our in-class time-stepping calculation with the same parameters we used before (including a heat capacity of $C = 4\times10^8$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$), but extend it to 50 years. **You should create an array of temperatures with 51 elements, beginning from 288 K**.
    - Now do it again, but use $C = 8\times10^8$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ (representing 200 meters of water). You should **create another 51-element array** of temperatures also beginning from 288 K.
    - **Make a well-labeled graph** that compares the two temperatures over the 50-year period.
    
4. What do your results show about the role of heat capacity on climate change? **Give a short written answer.**

## Problem 2: Albedo feedback in the Energy Balance Model

+++

For this exercise, we will introduce a new physical process into our model by **letting the planetary albedo depend on temperature**. The idea is that a warmer planet has less ice and snow at the surface, and thus a lower planetary albedo.

Represent the ice-albedo feedback through the following formula:

$$ \alpha(T) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\alpha_i &   & T \le T_i \\
\alpha_o + (\alpha_i-\alpha_o) \frac{(T-T_o)^2}{(T_i-T_o)^2} &   & T_i < T < T_o \\
\alpha_o &   & T \ge T_o \end{array} \right\}$$

with the following parameter values:

- $\alpha_o = 0.289$ is the albedo of a warm, ice-free planet
- $\alpha_i = 0.7$ is the albedo of a very cold, completely ice-covered planet
- $T_o = 293$ K is the threshold temperature above which our model assumes the planet is ice-free
- $T_i = 260$ K is the threshold temperature below which our model assumes the planet is completely ice covered. 

For intermediate temperature, this formula gives a smooth variation in albedo with global mean temperature. It is tuned to reproduce the observed albedo $\alpha = 0.299$ for $T = 288$ K. 

+++

1. 
    - Define a Python function that implements the above albedo formula. *There is definitely more than one way to do it. It doesn't matter how you do it as long as it works!*
    -  Use your function to calculate albedos for a wide range on planetary temperature (e.g. from $T=250$ K to $T=300$ K.)
    - Present your results (albedo as a function of global mean temperature, or $\alpha(T)$) in a nicely labeled graph.
    
2. Now investigate a climate change scenario with this new model:
    - Suppose that the transmissivity decreases from 0.611 to 0.57 (same as before)
    - Your task is to **calculate the new equilibrium temperature**. First, explain very briefly why you can't just solve for it analytically as we did when albedo was a fixed number.
    - Instead, you will use numerical time-stepping to find the equilibrium temperature
    - Repeat the procedure from Question 3 *(time-step forward for 50 years from an initial temperature of 288 K and make a graph of the results)*, but this time **use the function you defined above to compute the albedo for the current temperature**.
    - Is the **new equilibrium temperature larger or smaller** than it was in the model with fixed albedo? **Explain why in your own words.**

## Bonus problem

*Open-ended investigation for extra credit, not required*

Something very different occurs in this model if you introduce a strong negative radiative forcing, either by substantially reducing greenhouse gases (which we would represent as an increase in the transmissivity $\tau$), or by decreasing the incoming solar radiation $Q$.

Investigate, using your numerical model code, and report your results along with your thoughts.
