# The Climate Laboratory

***A hands-on approach to climate physics and climate modeling***

**By [Brian E. J. Rose][brian], University at Albany**

This will evolve into the textbook for both
[ENV 415: Climate Laboratory][env415] and [ATM 623: Climate Modeling][atm623]
at the [University at Albany][ualbany].

This book is powered by [JupyterBook][jupyterbook],
and aims to be all of the following:
- **self-reproducing** *(most figures are self-generating in the notebooks)*
- **free** and **open** *(permissive license, sources and content available through github)*
- **interactive** *(integration with JupyterHub and Binder will allow readers to run and modify code examples)*
- a **living document** *(content will continue to evolve, and collaboration is welcome)*

[To view the book online, go here][book].

The JupyterBook source and all book content (mostly [Jupyter Notebook][notebook] files)
are all in [this github repository][repo].

Much of the content is made possible by [climlab][climlab], an open-source
Python toolkit for interactive, process-oriented climate modeling.
[Brian Rose][brian] is the principle developer of climlab as well as the author of this book.
