Whereas, a conceptual model is a model made of the composition of concepts, that thus exists only in the mind.

Climate models are, likewise, idealised representations of a complicated and complex reality through which our understanding of the climate has significantly expanded. All models involve some ignoring, distoring and approximating, but gradually they allow us to build understanding of the system being modelled. A child's Lego construction typically contains the essential elements of the real objects, improves with attention to detail, helps them understand the real world, but is never confused with the real thing."

    "- **Climate** is essentially **statistics of weather**.\n",
    "- The planet **warms up** or **cools down** in response to **differences** between **energy absorbed from the sun** and **energy emitted to space**.\n",
    "- A **climate model** represents (mathematically of numerically) these **exchanges of energy** between the **Earth system** and **space**.\n",
    "- The observed emission to space or **Outgoing Longwave Radiation** is consistent with an emission temperature $T_e = 255$ K -- **much colder than Earth's surface**.\n",
    "- This is evidence of the **greenhouse effect**.\n",
    "- We adopted a very simple greenhouse model, assuming a fixed *transmissivity* $\\tau$ for the atmosphere. \n",
    "- $\\tau$ conceptually represents the *fraction of the emission from the **surface** that makes it all the way to space.* It is a number less than 1.\n",
    "- Python is fun and useful."
