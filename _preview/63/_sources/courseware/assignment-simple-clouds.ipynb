    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the two-layer \"leaky greenhouse\" (or grey radiation) model from [these lecture notes](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/elementary-greenhouse.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will use this model to investigate the **radiative effects of clouds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clouds simultaneously **reflect shortwave radiation** and **absorb longwave radiation**. These two effects often oppose each other in nature, and which one is stronger depends (among other things) on whether the clouds are **low** or **high** (i.e. in layer 0 or layer 1).\n",

    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a cloud reflects a fraction $\\alpha_c$ of the shortwave beam incoming from above. $\\alpha_c$ is a number between 0 and 1. Provide a coherent argument (in words, sketches, and/or equations) for why the **shortwave** effects cloud should alway be a **cooling** on the surface. Is this cooling effect different if the cloud is low or high? Explain."

    "\n",
    "Because the liquid water droplets in a cloud are effective absorbers of longwave radiation, a cloud will **increase the longwave absorptivity / emissivity** of the layer in which it resides. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this in the two-layer atmosphere by letting the absorptivity of a cloudy layer be $\\epsilon + \\epsilon_c$, where $\\epsilon_c$ is an additional absorptivity due to the cloud. Derive a formula (i.e. an algebraic expression) for the OLR in terms of the temperatures $T_s, T_0, T_1$ and the emissivities $\\epsilon, \\epsilon_c$ for two different cases:\n",
